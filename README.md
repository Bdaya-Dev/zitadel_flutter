## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application with ZITADEL integration.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## ZITADEL configuration

Make sure to create a native application. Add the redirects for mobile applications with your custom scheme (in our case `com.zitadel.zitadelflutter`) and your web redirect (in our case for local development `http://localhost:4444/auth.html`) and make sure to have enabled devMode.
